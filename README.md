Project management for Medical Rescue 2020

* Use the project [Medical Rescue 2020](https://github.com/orgs/RhinohawkUAV/projects/1) to organize high level tasking.
* Create Issues from Cards in the linked repos to drive specific progress. 
* If a new repo is made, use the Link feature in the project to connect that repo. This allows Issues to be created from Cards.
